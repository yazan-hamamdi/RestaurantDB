##  Performance and Optimization Notes

### 1. Use of CTEs (Common Table Expressions)
Used in `Reservation's Order with CTEs` to identify reservations with two or more orders.  
**Benefits:**  
- Improves readability and code organization.  
- Simplifies writing complex queries incrementally.  
- Reduces the need for additional temporary tables in memory.

---

### 2. Use of JOINS
Inner and Left Joins were used extensively, e.g.:  
- Linking orders to menu items (`Orders â†” MenuItems`)  
- Linking employees to restaurants (`Employees â†” Restaurants`)  
**Benefits:**  
- Efficiently combine data from multiple tables.  
- Reduce the number of separate queries, improving overall performance.  
- Ensure data integrity through direct relationships.

---

### 3. Use of Aggregation Functions
Functions like `SUM()`, `AVG()`, and `COUNT()` were used to calculate revenues, averages, and rankings.  
**Benefits:**  
- Perform statistical analysis directly in the database.  
- Generate reports quickly and efficiently.

---

### 4. Use of Window Functions
Functions like `RANK()` and `ROW_NUMBER()` were used for analyzing most popular items.  
**Benefits:**  
- Perform advanced analytics without subqueries.  
- Ideal for ranking and identifying top-selling items per restaurant.

---

### 5. Use of Triggers
A trigger logs new reservations into the `AuditLog` table.  
**Benefits:**  
- Ensures automatic auditing without application logic.  
- Increases transparency in data tracking.  
- Preserves historical data for reservations.

---

### 6. General Performance Practices
- `SET NOCOUNT ON` used in stored procedures to reduce overhead.  
- Validation of data using `IF EXISTS` before insert to prevent errors.  
- Indexes applied on frequently joined or filtered columns.  
- Views used for data abstraction and security.


   d.Organizing code with Views to simplify reuse and secure data access.
